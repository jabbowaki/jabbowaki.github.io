          You can ask someone what kind of music they like, but you&#8217re more likely to get an accurate answer if you ask what type of music they've been listening to lately.

          I wish this wasn&#8217t true, but the last emotional conflict I had was with my Mom just a couple weeks ago. She had flown into Chicago to visit me before I stopped communicating with the outside world(aka started Phase 1 at DBC). The first day was fine, but the second day I woke up stressed out.<span class="readMore"> <a href="blog-posts/week8_cultural_blog.html#c8">Read More >></span></a></p>

        <div class="blogListTitle"><p><a href="blog-posts/week7_cultural.html">C7: Values and Stereotype Threat - Sept 20,2014</a></div>
        When I think about times that I&#8217ve felt the happiest and most satisfied with my life, the following characteristics come to mind: achievement, meaningful work, close relationships, competency, personal development, physical challenge, and responsibility. <span class="readMore"><a href="blog-posts/week7_cultural.html#c7">Read More >></a></span></p>

        <div class="blogListTitle"><p><a href="blog-posts/week7_technical.html">T7: Injecting knowledge! - Sept 18,2014</a></div>
        Since SQL hasn&#8217t been mentioned here yet, allow me to give you just a brief overview. Pronounced es-queue-el or Sequel (depending on who you talk to), it stands for Structured Query Language. Essentially, it&#8217s a language that allows you to interact and manipulate data in databases. If you&#8217ve ever used a web app or done anything that involves a login, you&#8217ve most likely used SQL. <span class="readMore"><a href="blog-posts/week7_technical.html#t7">Read More >></a></span></p>

        <div class="blogListTitle"><p><a href="blog-posts/week6_cultural_blog.html">C6: Stereotype Threat - Sept 13,2014</a></div>
        I remember walking in to a room, surveying the audience, and taking a seat. It was my first meetup, and I was one of three women in a group of 25 or so. I was also, hands down, the youngest person there. As the speaker started talking (the topic was ruby on rails), I stared at the screen and mentally freaked out. <span class="readMore"><a href="blog-posts/week6_cultural_blog.html#c6">Read More >></a></span></p>

        After starting off the week not knowing what to do with inheritance, I thought that this could be an interesting topic to take on. It seemed that a lot of people were unsure what to do with the first challenge, so hopefully this post will help clarify things! <span class="readMore"><a href="blog-posts/week6_technical.html#t6">Read More >></a></span></p>

        <div class="blogListTitle"><p><a href="blog-posts/week5_cultural.html">C5: Pairing & Feedback - Sept 6, 2014</a></div>
        When I started doing phase 0 for DBC, pairing was my biggest concern. What if I didn&#8217t get along with my pair? What if I was the weak link? What if they were the weak link? <span class="readMore"><a href="blog-posts/week5_cultural.html#c5">Read More >></a></span></p>

        <div class="blogListTitle"><p><a href="blog-posts/week5_technical.html">T5: Getting Schooled on Class - Sept 5, 2014</a></div>
        Classes seemed really overwhelming at the beginning of this week (let&#8217s be honest, they were pretty crazy last week too). But really they&#8217re just like building a template so that you can be really lazy. And I&#8217m into that. Instead of having to individually type out mostly-identical code, classes allow you to be dry. <span class="readMore"><a href="blog-posts/week5_technical.html#t5">Read More >></a></span></p>

        I'm hesitant to write this post. When I was reading the challenges for this week, and saw that this blog was supposed to be about challenges in the technology community, being female was the first thing that came to mind. <span class="readMore"><a href="blog-posts/week4-cultural_blog.html#c4">Read More >></a></span></p>

        Do you know what an enumerable is? It's a mouthful, if nothing else. To explain it simply, enumerables allow objects of a class to act differently. Today, we're going to take a look at enumerable#cycle. <span class="readMore"><a href="blog-posts/week4_technical.html#t4">Read More >></a></span></p>

        You know how sometimes you read personality tests and you have a general idea of where you will land? Yeah, that's what I thought the first time I took the personal thinking style quiz. I thought for sure that I would be a concrete random or concrete sequential style. For sure. <span class="readMore"><a href="blog-posts/week3_cultural.html#c3">Read More >></a></span></p>

        I'm just going to come right out and say it: I am not comfortable with css positioning. It is mad tricky! So today I'm going to teach you (and me) about the differences in the types of positioning. <span class="readMore"><a href="blog-posts/week2_technical.html#t2">Read More >></a></span></p>

        Let me just start off by saying that I expected to see Shereef smoking a pipe and reading a newspaper in front of a roaring fire. That didn&#8217t happen. <span class="readMore"><a href="blog-posts/c1-chefs-kitchen.html#c1">Read More >></a></span></p>

        Three of my favorite websites are tumblr, Amazon, and Reddit. I'm not ashamed to say that. I like to shop, watch cat videos, and read up on personal finance. Guess which goes with which. <span class="readMore"><a href="blog-posts/t1-compare-websites.html#t1">Read More >></a></span></p>
