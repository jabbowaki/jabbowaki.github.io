    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p> My goal going into this was to get better at pairing and to figure out responsive sites work. I'd say overall this was pretty successful in that sense.</p>
    <p>Initially my pair and I had issues with the microphone on my computer (oops), and then had issues with internet connectivity. However, we eventually got it together and were able to work on the site. We had some challenges getting the buttons to line up horizontally rather than vertically, but changed them from a list to a div. Our next hurdle was getting the image to be responsive. Our main issue here ended up being syntax - we hadn't correctly written the code for the image in order to style it in css. Once we switched that, it ended up being fine.</p>
    <p>Looking back now, I'm starting to suspect that we didn't use the media queries as we were supposed to. I know we were a little bit thrown off by them, and didn't set a min or max-width. This is definitely a topic that I'm going to have to look further into, because I think responsive design is crucial to know.</p>
    <p>I think I struggle from doubt when I'm pairing, and it makes the process go slower because I'm second guessing what I'm typing as I drive. Because so many of us have never paired before starting Phase 0, they seem to be experiencing the same problem, so pairing takes longer than expected. When we do finally see a MVP, I'm quick to settle for it. Obviously, this has it's fair share of advantages and drawbacks. I think I need to work on being more confident of my code when others are looking at it.</p>
    <p>I'm pretty excited to have gotten fluidity down. I've been wondering how it works for a while, so that's cool. I'll be even more excited once I have a better understanding of how to integrated responsive design.</p>
