    <span id="date">08/22/2014</span>
      <p>So a couple months ago, I tried to learn Javascript on my own. I had just finished HTML/CSS on Codecademy, and I told myself that I would apply to DBC after finishing the Javascript course.</p>
      <p>Sweet Jesus, it's like the longest, most frustrating course ever (examples that don't show you examples! Code that makes no sense! Things not passing for no reason!). In case you can't tell, I'm still getting over my experience. So when I realized this was Javascript week...I was concerned.</p>
      <img src="../stylesheets/legally.gif" class="center"/>
      <p>But, I'll give in and admit it. Javascript is okay I guess.</p>
      <p>So why is it cool?
        <ul>
          <li>Let's start with the reason I understand best, which is that you can make it interactive. When someone clicks a button or scrolls over something, JavaScript can execute code that will make something happen, such as changing colors, popups, and page timeouts.</li>

          <li>You can build highly detailed games, such as <a href="http://multeor.com/">Multeor</a>, where you are an asteroid trying to inflict as much as destruction as possible(built in JavaScript and HTML5.) or the 3D game <a href="http://media.tojicode.com/q3bsp/">Quake</a>.</li>

          <li>Supposably it's a "realively easy language" to learn. I think that depends on the person and the method, but sure okay let's just agree with this.</li>

          <li>It's fast to the end user. Because the code is run on the user's computer, it's quick to process the tasks because it doesn't need to be processed on the site's server.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>But it does have it's flaws
        <ul>
          <li>There are security issues. Because the Javascript snippets run on the user's computer immediately, it could be used to exploit the user's system. I'm not entirely sure how this works, but I did read an interesting bit on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/373818/whats-with-those-do-not-use-javascript-people">Stack Overflow</a> about this, and it seemed like a heated debate.</li>
          <li>Different software components on browsers can make JavaScript render inconsistently, and no one wants that.</li>
        </ul>
      <p>I have to say, this week of JavaScript has actually been enjoyable. Hopefully it's a lanugage that I get more comfortable with, as it can add some real fun aspects to websites (like this one. This site could use some JavaScript).</p>
