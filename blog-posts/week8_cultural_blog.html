    <span id="date">09/27/2014</span>
      <p>I wish this wasn&#8217t true, but the last emotional conflict I had was with my Mom just a couple weeks ago. She had flown into Chicago to visit me before I stopped communicating with the outside world(aka started Phase 1 at DBC). The first day was fine, but the second day I woke up stressed out. My Mom was all over my apartment touching everything and moving everything around. Things were put in strange places and my whole routine was thrown off. Add the fact that I had my GPS scheduled for later that day, and I was just not in a good place. I tried to hide it and stay cool - I thought maybe if I told myself that I was being ridiculous, it would calm me down and put things in perspective. Well, it didn&#8217t. I ended up sullenly sitting at our table and being short to my Mom.</p>

      <p>In all her infinite wisdom, my Mom decided to take a walk and go explore Chicago a bit by herself. I offered to go with her(not that I really wanted to, but still), but she politely declined and said she wanted to look around by herself. Having an hour alone in my apartment did the trick - I realized that it was very sweet of my Mom to visit and that I shouldn&#8217t treat her visit like it was a bother. I mean, I love my Mom. Her giving me space reminded me that she was only going to be visiting for a bit, and that I should appreciate and make the most of my time with her. Once she got back, I explained that I was feeling stressed out and disoriented by having the change in my routine.</p>

      <p> Looking back, I think it might have just been better to explain to my Mom that I was stressed out right from the beginning. This would definitely have been more proactive and in addition to helping me feel better, would have prevented my Mom from any inconvenience or from feeling like a burden.</p>

      <p>My big takeaway from this experience is the realization that while I don&#8217t experience a lot of conflict in my life (thankfully), the conflict is often my own doing. While I&#8217m not always the best at practicing it, I find that open communication and being upfront about issues from the start is the best way to avoid conflict. Having all parties on the same page is a good thing. I know I won&#8217t always have the option, but taking some time to clear my head has also helped me deal with conflict effectively.</p>
