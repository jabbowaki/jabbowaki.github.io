      <p>Classes seemed really overwhelming at the beginning of this week (let&#8217s be honest, they were pretty crazy last week too). But really they&#8217re just like building a template so that you can be really lazy. And I&#8217m into that. Instead of having to individually type out mostly-identical code, classes allow you to be dry.</p>

      <p>So we&#8217re going to make a class called GroceryList (can you guess what it does?). The first thing that we&#8217ll need to do is define the class as class GroceryList. Note that class is not capitalized.</p>
      <img src="../stylesheets/class1.png" class = center>

      <p>Let&#8217s add a method called initialize, which will be initiated when a new thing is added to our GroceryList. We will assign it three arguments: name, location, price, because we&#8217ll want to know what the item is called, where in the store it is, and how much it costs each time that we add it to our list. We&#8217re going to add these arguments in the initialize method and define them as instance variables. By making them into instance variables, they can be accessed in other methods in our class without affecting inheritence. </p>
      <img src="../stylesheets/class2.png" class=center>

      <p>Now let&#8217s add something to our list, because we&#8217re out of food and need to go shopping!</p>
      <img src ="../stylesheets/class3.png" class=center>

      <p>As you can see, we need flour, milk, and ice cream... But isn&#8217t it the worst when you&#8217re at the store and you realize you didn&#8217t bring enough money? Let&#8217s avoid that. What we&#8217re going to do is add a class variable @@total_cost and set it to 0, as that will be the starting total. Then we&#8217ll add a method called total_cost that takes no arguments, and have it add the price of each item we add to our list.</p>
      <img src="../stylesheets/class4.png" class=center>

      <p>When we run this in our terminal, we get the following result:</p>
      <img src="../stylesheets/class5.png" class=center>
      <p>And you know what? We&#8217re adults. We can buy two pints of ice cream and eat them for dinner, and that&#8217s fine. So let&#8217s see what our bill would be if we bought 2â€¦</p>
      <img src="../stylesheets/class6.png" class=center>
      <img src="../stylesheets/class7.png" class=center>
      <p>So now we can see that if we want to get flour, milk, and two pints of ice cream, we will need $15. And think of how much time we saved instead of having to continously write this out! Yay laziness!</p>
