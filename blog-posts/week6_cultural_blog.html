    <div id="blogTitle"><h3>C6: Stereotype Threat</h3></div>
    <span id="date">09/13/2014</span>
      <p>I remember walking in to a room, surveying the audience, and taking a seat. It was my first meetup, and I was one of three women in a group of 25 or so. I was also, hands down, the youngest person there. As the speaker started talking (the topic was ruby on rails), I stared at the screen and mentally freaked out. &#8220WHY AM I HERE. WHAT WAS I THINKING?! I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I&#8217M DOING. THIS WAS A MISTAKE.&#8220 Talk about imposter syndrome. I had been so excited to go, but as the night wore on I shrank further into my seat and sweated like a teenage boy. I hesitated to ask questions when I got stuck and bolted out of there as soon as the speaker finished talking. I know this isn&#8217t the best example of stereotype threat, but I have no doubt that if I could time box more time for this blog I would come up with countless more stories. </p>

      <p>This week was the first time that I had ever heard the term <a href="http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/definition.html">stereotype threat</a>, which is when people fear that they will conform to the negative stereotypes that about their group. This threat can lead to underachievement, lowered performance, and can deter one from pursuing a field. </p>

      <p>When Claude M. Steele talked about discovering how to remove the stereotype threat that was creating the difference in test scores between men and women (about 25 minutes into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1fzIuuXlkk">this</a> video), I was shocked. Spoiler alert: tell women that nothing about their performance will be associate with their gender and that they will score just as well as men. It&#8217s really that simple, yet it surprised me that was all it took. It does makes sense though - when I am in a position where I am the minority, I start to second guess myself and my ideas.</p>

      <p>One of the <a href="http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/reduce.html">methods</a> that helps eliminate stereotype threat is to emphasize the characteristics that bond the group. For me, that would be to focus on the fact that I&#8217m a part of the Wolf cohort instead of the fact that I&#8217m female. Another way that sounds like a no brainer is to encourage self-affirmation/self-worth, which in my experience is easier said than done. Reminding myself that I&#8217m awesome and that I got into DBC for a reason can be the boost I need to keep myself from sinking. </p>

      <p>I think the takeaway from this is to acknowledge that everyone will feel singled out at some point, and that we should be mindful of this. The ASK feedback(actionable, specific, and kind) is a good way to effectively encourage others, as there is the emphasis on promoting constructive yet positive feedback. I&#8217m glad that we are getting practice doing this before being on site, because the habit will help make our transition into DBC smoother and ease any tensions that should develop. </p>
