    <div id="blogTitle"><h3>T8: Did you mean recursion?</h3></div>
    <span id="date">09/26/2014</span>
      <p>Earlier this year, I googled recursion. This is what resulted:</p>

      <p>I totally didn&#8217t get it, and if you didn&#8217t either than this blog post is for you. Chances are you've seen or used recursion without even realizing it. There used to be a restaurant near my house when I was growing up, and we would often get takeout from there. The restaurant was shaped like a square, and two of the parallel walls were panelled with mirrors. I remember staring at myself staring at myself staring at myself, which for the record, is a great way to keep a kid entertained. That&#8217s essentially a real world example of recursion.</p>

      <p>Recursion is used to solve something by calling itself. It&#8217s somewhat similar to a loop, except that instead of continuing a certain number of times, it will continue until a condition has been met. But when would we use recursion? We might use it to find the next number in fibonacci&#8217s sequence or to countdown. </p>

      <br> weeks ago and have been waiting to use one too.</div>

      <p>The important thing with recursive programming is that unless an end point (or base case) is specified, it will run forever, and will crash your program or browser. So it&#8217s crucial to make sure that is specified. Since ruby doesn&#8217t have an easy way to do factorials, such as (n!), I&#8217ll make one for example.</p>

      <p>The way this works is that it takes a number as an argument. Then it goes &#8220<em>hey Bro, are you equal to 1? Nah? Okay, let&#8217s multiply you by one less of yourself. Bro, you equal to 1? Nah? Okay, lets...</em>&rdquo; on and on until it determines that the number is equal to one, as one is our specified break point. Once the number is equal to once, it terminates. </p>
