    <div id="blogTitle"><h3>T7: Injecting knowledge!</h3></div>
    <span id="date">09/18/2014</span>
      <p>Since SQL hasn&#8217t been mentioned here yet, allow me to give you just a brief overview. Pronounced <strong>es-queue-el</strong> or &#8216Sequel&#8217 (depending on who you talk to), it stands for Structured Query Language. Essentially, it&#8217s a language that allows you to interact and manipulate data in databases. If you&#8217ve ever used a web app or done anything that involves a login, you&#8217ve most likely used SQL. It&#8217s everywhere!</p>

      <p>And since it&#8217s everywhere and contains loads of information, naturally there are people who will try to gain access to that information. The process that they use is called SQL injection. What happens is that SQL commands will be entered into a field(such as a login or a form) and will run as part of the database. This could potentially allow someone to bypass a login, gain access to credit card information, or delete important databases.</p>

      <div class="text_title"><h3>The Danger of 1=1</h3></div>

      <p>Let&#8217s say that on a web application there is a user input for their name. If the application hasn&#8217t been properly sanitized, someone could put their UserId as <code>101 OR 1=1</code>. When this get&#8217s run in the SQL, it&#8217ll be run like below:
        <div class=code><pre><code>SELECT * FROM users WHERE UserId = 101 or 1=1</code></pre></div>
      Because <code>WHERE 1=1</code> will always be true (because one does equals one), this would return all the rows from the table. Similarly, using <code>&#8220&rdquo;</code> or <code>&#8220=&rdquo;</code> could do the same, since <code>&#8220=&rdquo;</code> will return true. </p>

      <p>Another terrifying thing that could happen would be if someone hacked in and deleted a table, and it&#8217s surprisingly easy to do. Like in our example above, someone could tack in <code>101; DROP TABLE ImportantInfo;</code> and this would create the following command in SQL:
        <div class=code><pre><code>SELECT * FROM users WHERE userId = 101; DROP TABLE ImportantInfo;</code></pre></div>
        SQL would read the first command as anything up to the semicolon, which in this case would be to return the information for userId 101. Then it would read the command after the semicolon, which is to delete table ImportantInfo.</p>

    <div class="text_title"><h3>Prevention</h3></div>

    <p>As a newbie, I can recognize the brilliance of injection, but am not well versed in the ways of preventing it. It seems like the best way to prevent injection would be to build parameters for SQL. <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SQL_Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet#Defense_Option_1:_Prepared_Statements_.28Parameterized_Queries.29">Parameterized Queries</a> essentially check to see if the users input literally matched the information. So in our above example, it would check to see if <code>101 or 1=1</code> was a user&#8217s id. </p>

    <p>Another way to prevent injection would be to use stored procedures, which acts similarly to prepared statements, with the difference being that stored procedures are defined and stored in the database. The procedures would then be called to the application when needed.  </p>

    <p>The third main defense against injection would be escaping all user supplied input. To do this, you would escape the users input before putting it in the query, which prevents SQL from confusing the users input with the code written by the developer. However, this method should be used with caution, as it is not as sturdy as the previous two methods.</p>

    <p>It is essential to use preventative methods to avoid inject if you plan on using SQL. Security breaches are becoming more and more often (I&#8217m looking at you Target), and they never end well. Knowing how to prevent it from happening in the first place is crucial, and I hope to gain more with this as I continue learning about SQL.</p>
