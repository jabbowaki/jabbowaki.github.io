    <span id="date">09/12/2014</span>
      <p>After starting off the week not knowing what to do with inheritance, I thought that this could be an interesting topic to take on. It seemed that a lot of people were unsure what to do with the first challenge, so hopefully this post will help clarify things!</p>
      <div class="text_title"><h3>Inheritance</h3></div>

      <p>Inheritance links two classes and allows the lower class to retain features of a higher class. Just as you might have the same color eyes as your parent, a subclass will have the same methods as it&#8217s super-class(unless it&#8217s overridden). All of the features from the super-class will be given to the sub-class. Take a look at the example below:</p>

      <img src="../stylesheets/inherit1.png" class=center>
      <p>In our example above, we made two classes. The first is Dessert, and the second is Cookie. The less than sign indicates that Cookie is a subclass of Dessert. While that delicious method isn&#8217t written in Cookie&#8217s class, it is inherited from Dessert, and that is further demonstrated when oreo is run. But what if we decide that we don&#8217t want oreo to say that? We would have to override it by changing the function while retaining the method name. </p>
      <img src ="../stylesheets/inherit2.png" class = center>
      <p>It&#8217s worth noting that a class can only inherit from one class, so Cookie couldn&#8217t inherit from Dessert and Snacks.</p>
      <div class="text_title"><h3>Composition</h3></div>
      <p>Composition works by creating an object of a class inside of a different class. If you&#8217re wondering, this was what we were supposed to be doing in the first challenge when we all got stuck. Using composition allows you to selectively use methods that are in other classes. In the example below, we use the wow method from Dessert inside of Cookie class.
      </p>
      <img src="../stylesheets/comp1.png" class = center>
      <p>The cool thing about that this is that it allows you to use portions of code without having to worry about unintentionally inheriting something you don&#8217t want. It also eliminates the concern that something won't get overwritten. Basically, it means that it&#8217s harder for you to forget something and break everything.</p>

      <p>So while they can do fairly similar things, knowing when to use inheritance or composition can mean saving or adding more work to your plate. I'll end on a great programming joke I head last month:</p>
