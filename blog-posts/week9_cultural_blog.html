      <p>You can ask someone what kind of music they like, but you're more likely to get an accurate answer if you ask what type of music they've been listening to lately.</p>

      <p>I&#8217m pretty sure the motto for my middle school was &#8220There&#8217s no such thing as a dumb question.&#8221 It&#8217s interesting that we&#8217ve been taught to ask questions, but not actually <em>how</em> to ask questions. By asking poorly worded and structured questions, we&#8217re less likely to get an accurate or helpful response. In some cases, the correct answer might not really matter in the grand scheme of things. However that won&#8217t always be the case, and if you&#8217ve ever spent a late night googling without getting any helpful Stack Overflow articles then knowing how to ask questions can be a huge time saver.</p>

      <p>The worst is when you&#8217re reading a headline and it&#8217s too vague to mean anything. Be clear about what your question is, and ensure that everything is spelled right. If nothing else, make sure that the question is phrased in a way that makes sense.</p>

      <p>Be specific about what your problem is and supply as much relevant detail as possible in your question. Make it as easy as possible for someone to help you. And for god&#8217s sake, if your questions is regarding code, put in the code that you&#8217re having a problem with! It removes a lot of guess work for the people who will be answering the question, which means that it becomes more likely that someone will answer your question.</p>

      <p>Finally, reply to the answers that you&#8217ve received. Did they work? If not, what happened when you tried the solution? Make a point to update about your situation - not only is doing so polite, but will be appreciated when (inevitably) someone else has the same question.</p>
