    <span id="date">08/15/2014</span>
      <p>I'm just going to come right out and say it: I am not comfortable with css positioning. It is mad tricky! So today I'm going to teach you (and me) about the differences in the types of positioning.</p>

      <p><h4>Static</h4>
        <br>Let's start from the bottom, shall we? Static is basically the default position. I guess you could add position:static if you wanted, but it does violate DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). <a href-"http://css-tricks.com/absolute-relative-fixed-positioining-how-do-they-differ/">Treehouse</a> informs me that you only really need it "to forcefully-remove some positioning that got applied to an element outside of your control", but I think it's safe to say that won't be often.<p>

      <p><h4>Relative</h4>
        <br>Okay, so relative positioning is tricky, both to use and explain. By itself, it acts like a static element, however that changes once you start adding properties such as top, right, bottom, and left. Once those are added, it moves that distance away from where it was previously (or where it would have been as a static element).
      </p>

      <p><h4>Fixed</h4>
        <br>A fixed positioning means that no matter which way you scroll, the element stays in that spot. Take a look at facebook for a good example of this. That blue search bar on the top of the page? That's a fixed element.
      </p>

      <p><h4>Absolute</h4>
        <br>So absolute acts like a fixed element, except that it is in realtion to a relative element. Which pretty much means that it's not like a fixed elemenet at all. Basically, it finds a relative element, but then does it's own thing according to the relative element. I think <a href="http://learnlayout.com/position-example.html">this</a> page does a really good job of illustrating what this looks like.
