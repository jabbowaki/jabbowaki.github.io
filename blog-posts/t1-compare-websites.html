    <span id="date">08/08/2014</span>
      <p>Three of my favorite websites are <strong>tumblr</strong>,<strong> Amazon</strong>, and <strong>Reddit</strong>. I'm not ashamed to say that. I like to shop, watch cat videos, and read up on personal finance. Guess which goes with which.</p>
      <p>With <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/dashboard">tumblr</a>, my eye is immediately drawn to the middle of the screen. The login section is the only consistent part of the page, as the background image changes each time you view it. Even from far away, this is the easiest thing to see, as it's smack dab in the middle. Because tumblr has such a variety of content(text, images, photos, and music), the simplicity of the layout of their site ensures that the content is the main focus. If you don't have an account with tumblr, you can't access any of their content. However, once you've made an account, you have almost no interaction with the site itself. The home page, or dashboard, is made up entirely by your feed, with the occasional sponsored post (they are surprisingly rare). I've used this site for over 5 years, so obviously I enjoy the user experience. I can definitely attest to it being a time suck depending on who you follow, but it can also be a great resource for discovering news, interesting music, and meeting and following people.</p>
      <p>I onced referred to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a> as my internet boyfriend because of how much I loved it. Also, I was younger and stupid. Amazon is my go to for internet shopping because in addition to having low prices and free shipping, they are by far the site with the most product reviews. I associate Amazon as being a clean, easy to use experience, but one look at their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/site-directory/ref=nav_sad">directory</a> shows otherwise. Someone recently pointed out to me how cluttered it is, and they're completely right. I suspect that no one actually visits that page. Even their homepage can be overwhelming - I'm sure they want you to look at their graphics, but I always just tune it out and go straight to the toolbar. I do wonder if people would spend more time on their homepage if they just simplified it a bit though. </p>
      <p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/">Reddit</a> is a beast of it's own. If you've never used Reddit, then allow me to introduce you. It's basically the craziest site on the internet, and to top it off, it looks sketchy. As in Craigslist sketchy. They use very little graphics, every page is cluttered, and I don't know how to use many of the functions. However, the content is what makes this site so valauble. Do you want to know some crazy fact about <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Awwducational/">otters</a>? Reddit has something about it. Do you want to understand how <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/2d31rr/eli5_how_did_knowing_einsteins_theory_of/">Einstein's theory of relativity lead to the making of the first atomic bomb</a>? Oh that's on Reddit too. The ability to subscribe to particular interests and then have them show up in your feed on your login is nice, but I've found that it's often easier to just go to that topic's page rather than shifting through everything. User experience wise, this site is a mess. But the content is what makes this site gold.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="http://vitamintalent.com/ux-statistic/">this</a> beautiful site, UX is directly responsible for making successful websites. I think that's true to an extent. In my opinnion, out of the sites that I've listed, only tumblr has a truely enjoyable user experience. Yet while the other two sites are lacking in that department, I believe their content more than makes up for what they are missing. Maybe that's just me though.</p>
