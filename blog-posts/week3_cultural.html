      <p>You know how sometimes you read personality tests and you have a general idea of where you will land? Yeah, that's what I thought the first time I took the personal thinking style quiz. I thought <strong>for sure</strong> that I would be a concrete random or concrete sequential style. For sure.</p>

      <p>Guess who tied for abstract random and abstract sequential? That didn't inital seem like me, so I retook the test on a different site and got the same results. At least I'm consistent. </p>


      <p>So after looking up how abstract thinkers learn best, I can start to see how this might be accurate. I hate feeling constricted or micromanaged. Nothing about competitions interest me. I already know that I need to talk out my problems and thoughts, even if I've already made a decision. I apologize to all my fellow wolves in advance, as I realize this is going to drive some people crazy.</p>

      <p>My problems have varied per week. The first week, I lost so much time just tinkering with my <a href="jabbowaki.github.io">io site</a>. The second week I vowed to not have that happen again, and started timeboxing, which helped a lot. But then I started pairing, which has been my latest problem. I feel incredibly awkward talking with people I don't really know, which has made me realize that it's easier to work when I have connections with the people around me. Once I've made a connection with them though, it's all smooth sailing though.</p>

      <p>I've always felt that the hardest thing to do is acknowldge where you struggle. It's hard to admit that you're human and not perfect all the time. This is where the growth mindset plays in - we need to be aware of our faults, and recognize that these aren't permanent. These are things that we can grow into and out of. They aren't curses that we are capped by, rather they are things that we can overcome. Failure of some level will be inevitable, and I'll have to remind myself to take it in stride and see it as a chance to grow and improve. I'm expecting these next couple of months to be full of failure, but I should get used to receiving it and using it to improve myself. This is going to be a hard fall.</p>
