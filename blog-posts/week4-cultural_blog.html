    <span id="date">08/31/2014</span>
      <p>I&#39;m hesitant to write this post. When I was reading the challenges for this week, and saw that this blog was supposed to be about challenges in the technology community, being female was the first thing that came to mind.</p>

      <p>When earlier this year I told my Mom that I wanted to go into coding, she was baffled because she said that it was not something she had anticipated me enjoying. I can understand why. It&#39;s nothing that I had even considered when I was growing up. And why hadn&#39;t I? Looking back, I had never been exposed to working with technology. I&#39;m sure my high school had some sort of computer science club, but there is no doubt in my mind that it was comprised entirely of male teenagers and I wouldn&#39;t have felt comfortable.</p>

      <p>Yet here we are today: me, the only female in my cohort. I'm not too surprised - per <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2013/04/29/178810467/blazing-the-trail-for-female-programmers">NPR</a>, approximately 20% of programmers are women. I don&#39;t mind, but it is strange to know that whenever they send out group emails, I&#39;m the gal in the &ldquo;hey guys and gal&rdquo;.</p>

      <p>It is intimidating to go into a field where I will be different from everyone else. I fear being looked down on and having my anger and frustration being written off as PMS. I fear harassment and belittlement, and people assuming that my accomplishments are not my own.</p>

      <p>But I think this can change. Getting more women into the tech community can change that standard, so that women aren&#39;t strange but are the norm. It won&#39;t be easy, and I doubt it&#39;ll be a quick fix.
      <br>
      But here are my suggestions:
        <ol>
          <li>Stop teaching boys and girls that they should be playing with gendered toys. Boys can play with dolls and girls can play with legos and the world won&#39;t fall apart. Encourage their interest in topics that historically are gendered</li>
          <li>Start teaching programming as a language in schools. If more people see it as a language such as Spanish or French, perhaps there won&#39;t be this cultural  insistence that computer science is something only boys are interested in. We can change it to something that everyone is interested in.</li>
          <li>Emphasize empathy. Rape jokes are not okay. Have you ever heard someone who has been assaulted or raped tell a rape joke? No? Yeah, there&#39;s a reason for that. Get rid of the culture where rape jokes, get-back-in-the-kitchen jokes and make-me-a-sandwich jokes are permissible, and you&#39;ll foster an environment that is welcoming to women, the LGBTQ community, and anyone who feels like an outsider.</li>
          <li>Support programs that are already in place that encourage women into tech roles. My personal favorite, <a href="http://www.girldevelopit.com/">Girl Develop It</a>, has chapters through out the country, and I have nothing but glowing things to say about my experiences there (pro tip: there are always guys at the meetups and it&#39;s totally fine). Some other ones worth checking out: <a href="https://www.womenwhocode.com/">Women Who Code</a>, <a href="https://www.madewithcode.com/">Made With Code</a>, and <a href="http://www.blackgirlscode.com/">Black Girls Code</a>.
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>I know that it'll take a while for things to change, but if we can implement at least some of these strategies, the tech community will adapt, just as it always does.</p>
