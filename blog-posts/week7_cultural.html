    <div id="blogTitle"><h3>C7: Values and Stereotype Threat</h3></div>
    <span id="date">09/20/2014</span>
    <p>When I think about times that Iâ€™ve felt the happiest and most satisfied with my life, the following characteristics come to mind: achievement, meaningful work, close relationships, competency, personal development, physical challenge, and responsibility</p>

      <p>For me, the most important characteristics is close relationships. When I moved out to Chicago 7 years ago, I knew no one. Thankfully though, I&#8217ve developed close friendships with people who have encouraged me and been a support system for me. It&#8217s hard to imagine a life without them.</p>

      <p>I general, I try to live up to these values on a 1-5 scales, with 1 being disagree
        <ul>
          <li>achievement -4</li>
          <li>meaningful work - 5</li>
          <li>close relationships - 4</li>
          <li>competency - 4</li>
          <li>personal development - 4</li>
          <li>physical challenge -3</li>
          <li>responsibility - 4</li>
        </ul>
      Thinking about my values reminded me how hard I&#8217ve worked and how much I&#8217ve achieved. They&#8217re also a reminder that there is room for me to improve. I realize that I&#8217m not always on my A game, and looking at my scale above made me realize that. </p>

      <p>I know that I&#8217m going to struggle in DBC, but hopefully I&#8217ll be able to remember what I&#8217m previously accomplished and that I&#8217m capable. When I start to feel like I&#8217m drowning, I&#8217m going to try to find a way to talk with my friends and family, even if it&#8217s just a quick check in text. If I&#8217m able to fit in some exercise as well, such as a quick run or bike ride, it would also help me clear my mind.
