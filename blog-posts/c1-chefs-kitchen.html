    <span id="date">08/10/2014</span>
      <p>Let me just start off by saying that I expected to see Shereef smoking a pipe and reading a newspaper in front of a roaring fire. That didn&rsquo;t happen.</p>

      <p>Instead it was him confirming my fears and expectations for DBC. It
        was oddly comforting to hear. One of his points was that we have the mindset of "I paid for it, therefore I should get it", or as he calls it, the restaurant/table mindset. This consumer mindset isn&rsquo;t going to work well at DBC, where your success is related to how much you put in. The kitchen mindset is that we're all in the kitchen making our own success. We're making risotto (if you watch any competitive cooking shows, you know how finicky this can be), and if that risotto come outs too dry or salty, we&rsquo;ll have to go back and tweak our recipe. Our dish is only going to be as good as make it.
      </p>
      <p>He&rsquo;s right about it being difficult to get in the kitchen
        mindset. I know that&rsquo;s going to be an issue for me somedays. Having said that, I understand that what I get out of this is going to be relative to what I put in. Once I found out I had gotten into DBC, I started asking other alumni about advice. What do I need to go going in? One of the alumni told me that this will be the hardest thing I will have ever done. So the pressure is there.</p>
      <h4>"Some of you are walking in not worried... you should be."</h4>
      <p>Oh yes, I am plenty worried. I know that I&rsquo;ll rise to the c
        hallenge, but I still suffer from imposter syndrome occasionally. It&rsquo;s hard not to be nervous when you&rsquo;re concerned that you don&rsquo;t even deserve to be here. Donâ€™t get me wrong - it&rsquo;s not all of the time, but I definitely had a moment after getting stuck on one of the Socrates exercises. At least now I know that I won&rsquo;t be the only one there feeling that way.
