        <h2>Importance of Pairing</h2>
        <p>Pairing is great for many reasons. Working together allows you to
            bounce ideas off of each other and check each other's work. It helps
            you to get comfotable talking about code and best practices. It is
            particularly important while working on a big project in which many
            people are involved so that consistancy can be maintained.
        </p>
        <h2>Driver Vs Navigator</h2>
        <p>
            Navigator provides overall direction for where the program should go
            and produce it's overall vision. The driver should be more hands on
            with the actual construction of the code and syntax so that you
            don't have both people producting conflicting code and style.
        </p>
        <h2>Reflections</h2>
        <p>Not too bad for the first time! It was not too awkward. It helped that
        the guide would stop us from doing anything awful. The actual writing of the
        paragraphs and body was somewhat awkward, but the coding part wasn't bad.
        It seemed like pairing worked as it was expected to - when one of us overlooked
        something, the other was able to spot it.
